# Banking_Services_Performance_and_Feedback_Database

•	This was the final project under the subject Data Management of Analytics which helped develop and demonstrate necessary data management skills by working with SQL and NOSQL databases with analysis in Python by integrating Mysql workbench and visualizations in Tableau.

•	Developed a banking database from scratch, to examine customer complaints and communication channels, identify the conversion rate of online complaints in progress, and measure customer traffic by analyzing the number of accounts opened per year.

•	By analyzing the customer complaints and communication channels, the project provides insights into the customer feedback and their preferred modes of communication for registering complaints. This information allows the bank to understand customer preferences and tailor their complaint management processes accordingly, ensuring a seamless customer experience.

•	The project's findings offer valuable insights for making strategic decisions related to branch management, expansion, and resource allocation. Banks can use the data on customer complaints, ratings, and account openings to identify opportunities for improvement, optimize branch networks, and allocate resources effectively. These decisions ultimately contribute to overall business growth and customer satisfaction.
